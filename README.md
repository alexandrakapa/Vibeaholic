Our project is an android music app called Vibeaholic that consists of two parts:
* **Everyday mode**: The user can listen to songs,search for songs etc like an ordinary music app but also activate "Feel me" mode
that enables camera, microphone and/or smartwatch in order to determine his feelings and suggest songs/playlists
depending on his mood
* **Party mode**: The user can enter or create a party that collects music data from the participants and make playlists that
suit the music taste of the participants
